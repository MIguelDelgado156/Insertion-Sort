# Insertion-Sort
InsertSort Implementation as guided by Absolute Java V4 Chapter 12, Project 9

This implementation of the Insert Sort sorts the array until end - 1 using a bubble sort. It then calls a Join function to complete the sort using a Insertion Sort.
This is most likely the most inefficient way to do this, as a regular Insertion Sort would be able to handle the entire array as long as it doesnt get to big. If you have any
recomendations at to make this more efficient leave a comment. This was for a school assigment and was interpreted from the textbook.
